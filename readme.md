### 1. **Be a Good Human being First** 🌟

_Before anything else, be genuinely good. Treat everyone with respect, show empathy, and remember that behind every screen is a real person with feelings, dreams, and challenges. Good people build great companies._

### 2. **Check Your Ego at the Door** 🎭

_Your ideas are not you. Your code is not your identity. Be open to criticism, celebrate others' wins, and remember: the best idea wins, not the loudest voice. **Humility is our competitive advantage**._

### 3. **There's No 'I' in the Team, We're a Tribe** 🏕️

_We succeed together or fail together. Every victory belongs to the tribe, every challenge is faced as one. When you say "I did this," say "We achieved this" instead. Unity multiplies our impact._

### 4. **Design First, Code Second** 📋

_Never code in isolation. Share your ideas in a design document, get input from the tribe, and build consensus before building features. Great software starts with great collaboration._

### 5. **Feedback is the greatest Gift, Give It Generously** 💝

_Don't hold back your thoughts. Constructive feedback isn't criticism, it's caring enough to help someone grow as a developer but also as a person. The best teams challenge each other to be better every single day._

### 6. **Iterate Like Your Success Depends on It** 🔄

_Because it does. Take feedback, evolve your ideas, and never fall in love with your first solution. Greatness happens with the iterations, not the initial spark._

### 7. **Radical Transparency Always** 🔍

_No hidden agendas, no sugar-coating bad news, no keeping teammates in the dark. Share your struggles, celebrate your wins, and trust that honesty builds stronger bonds than politeness._

### 8. **Kindness is Our Secret Weapon** 💙

_In a world of technical complexity, human kindness stands out. Be patient with mistakes, generous with praise, and always assume positive intent. Kindness scales better than any algorithm._

### 9. **Time is Our Most Precious Resource** ⚰️

_Respect everyone's time by being punctual. Whether it's a 5-minute standup or a strategic planning session, showing up on time shows you value your teammates and their contributions._

### 10. **Spend Smart, Think ROI** 💰

_Every dollar matters, whether it's VC money or our own. Before any purchase, ask: "Will this drive measurable value?" Treat company resources like your personal savings, because responsible growth is sustainable growth._

### 11. **Trust the Process, Embrace the Journey** 🛤️

_Great things take time. Trust our methods, respect our workflows, and believe in the vision. When processes feel slow, remember: they're designed to prevent bigger problems down the road._
